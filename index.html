<title>Thank You</title>
<h2>I am no longer keeping this site up due to multiple factors. First being the constant rivalry between me and other programmers. Second is the amount I have spent on this project, I have spent over 50$ on just hosting services, that might not seem like much but for a broke middle school student it is. Third the amount of stress I have been under the last couple of months is to much for me to handle, becuase it seems everyday some problem occured with either the hosters, domains, or go guardian. Thank you to everyone using and supporting this project, and all source code will be public on Github.</h2>
